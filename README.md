## Back-end
- The URL fetched from the first page i.e form.html is split to fetch the username and the name of repository.
- Requests module is used to make a GET request to the github repo api to fetch the total issues count i.e `open_issues_count` key.
- Since, issues were spread across multiple pages and were limited to only 30. Pagination is used to fetch total issues present in multiple pages by changing the default `per-page` parameter to 100.
- Again a GET request is made to issues api using the above obtained username, repo and page details.
- The response obtained is used to segregate the issues basis the timestamp values i.e `created_at` key.
- The final data is rendered to data.html. 
- Any error in the input url viz. invalid url, inaccessible url etc. will lead to error.html.
